## Why is this a submodule of the TurtleNet project?
While TurtleLib does not have any direct connection to TurtleNet, it will be treated as a module of that project for now.
This does violate the principles of cohesion, separation of concerns and reusability. However, this does ensure a better
maintainability in the context of development.

It should be considered to detach this module from the project later on, when the initial development is done.
